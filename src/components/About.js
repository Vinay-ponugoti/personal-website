            <p>
            I am a highly motivated and eager web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
             I have completed a number of online courses and am constantly learning new technologies through personal
              projects and participation in online communities. While I do not have professional experience in the field,
               I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and contribute value to a team. I am excited to start my career
                as a web developer and am seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience and grow my skills. In my free time,
                 I enjoy building websites for personal use and participating in coding challenges.
